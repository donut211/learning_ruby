There are many {{adjective}} ways to choose {{noun}} to read. First, you could

ask for recommendations from your friends and {{plural noun}}. Just don't ask 

Aunt {{female in room}}-she only reads {{adjective_2}} books with 

{{article of clothing}}-ripping goddesses on the cover. If your friends and

family are no help, try checking out the {{noun_2}} Review in The {{city}} Times.
 
If the {{plural noun_2}} featured there are too {{adjective_3}} for your taste, try 

something a little more low-{{body part}}, like {{letter of alphabet}}: The 

{{celebrity}} Magazine, or {{plural noun_3}} Magazine. You could also choose a book
 
the {{adjective_4}}-fashioned way. Head to your local library or {{a place}} and 

browse the shelves until something catches your {{body part_2}}. Or, you could save
 
yourself a whole lot of {{adjective_5}} trouble and log on to www.bookish.com, the

{{adjective_6}} new website to {{verb}} for books! With all the time you'll save not
 
having to search for {{plural noun_4}}, you can read {{number}} more books!
